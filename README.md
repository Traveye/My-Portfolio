# My-Portfolio

## Purpose

This project serves to demonstrate my understanding and application of HTML and CSS at the current time and as an ongoing project to update as my knowledge and experience develops. Its function is to be a central location where my personal information and work can be reviwed by propsective employers. Utilizing flexbox, I endeavored to create a responsive site desingn that was aesthetically pleassing and also meets the following criteria.

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
1. WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
2. WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
3. WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
4. WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
5. WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
6. WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.

To build the site I created a large container and in which I placed four individual parent containers. One is for the Header and Navigation, one for the About section, another to link to Work repositories, and a final container for Contact information. Both the large container and subsequent parent containers were set to flex to allow a smooth and responsive design. Additionally, media query was utilized to optimize the display at smaller viewport sizes. I selected background and font colors to lend a vibrant and modern aesthetic. 

After the intial development and deployment of this application, I have gained a greater working understanding of how to structure and organize HTML as well as how to employ flexbox to create dynamic and responsive pages. As well, this project highlights for me the importance of planning as part of the development process and the importance of concise and organized HTML elemnts, classes, and IDs.
